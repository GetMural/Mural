But just a few hundred meters before it joins Kolubara, Gradac runs out of it's beautiful gorge, which is about 15 kilometers long and in some places a few hundred meters high. Being that close to the town, yet still preserving it's natural values, Gradac gorge is a favorite short-trip destination for locals and others. And not only in the summer.","src":"http://storyteller-dev.lab.sourcefabric.org","share":false,"facebook":false,"twitter":true},"items":[{"imagebackground":{"id":"0","format":{"fullpage":true},"title":"Default","subtitle":"Chapter #1","navlevel":"first-level","navthumb":"http://storyteller-dev.lab.sourcefabric.org/images/cache/215x115/crop/images%7Ccms-image-000000525.jpg","text":"<p>From winter religious ceremony (pictured here: Bishop of Valjevo on Epiphany celebration), to hot summer days swimming and cooling off (water temperature is around 16C and deep shade of the gorge and high trees keep the climate refreshing even in the hottest days with temperatures close to 40C), to fly-fishing, hiking & trekking, to speleology, mushroom-hunting, or simply picnicking in the tens of different locations alongside the river - Gradac is attractive all year long.</p><p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, est diceret incorrupte ad, ei usu eruditi sadipscing, malis delenit fuisset vis cu.

It is reputed to be the most dangerous of the European vipers due to its large size, long fangs (up to 13 mm) and high venom toxicity. The specific name, ammodytes, is derived from the Greek words ammos, meaning \"sand\", and dutes, meaning \"burrower\" or \"diver\", despite its preference for rocky habitats. Five subspecies are currently recognized.</p><p>The <em>spotted salamander</em> or yellow-spotted salamander is about 15–25 cm (5.9–9.8 in) long. They are stout, like most mole salamanders, and have wide snouts. The spotted salamander's main color is black, but can sometimes be a blueish-black, dark grey, dark green, or even dark brown. Two uneven rows of yellowish-orange spots run from the top of the head (near the eyes) to the tip of the tail.
