    <p>Mural's pretty great, right?
    Mural is an open source project, licensed under the AGPL. Mural is free to use and will always remain that way. But before you hit the download button, please consider that it costs us money to continue improving the app and creating quality code. Please consider sending a donation through PayPal or setting up a Patreon account to help us keep our developers in coffee. Enjoy your Mural story!</p>


    <p>We take Paypal donations - buy us a coffee! Our developers love that stuff.</p>
